    <h2>The Scent</h2>
    <p>
      S E E N is not designed to impress.  
      It is designed to remain.  
      A restrained composition — dark, clean, controlled —  
      leaving an imprint without asking permission.

    <p>
      Minimal. Weighted. Intentional.  
      Nothing decorative. Nothing accidental.

    <h2>About S E E N</h2>
    <p>
       S E E N was born from a pursuit of clarity and restraint, a desire to craft a fragrance that reflects presence without performance. Every element was considered with care the balance of notes, the weight of each accord, the harmony of the whole forming a scent that exists quietly yet unmistakably.

The fragrance reveals itself in layers. Subtle warmth and depth emerge over time, unfolding with a deliberate rhythm that rewards attention. It lingers softly, a presence that evolves naturally, intimate yet persistent, composed without excess.

Created with the finest ingredients, each element is chosen for its purity and ability to interact harmoniously with the skin. S E E N is a study in restraint and refinement, a fragrance that is simultaneously personal and enduring a quiet signature, carefully measured and artfully realized.
